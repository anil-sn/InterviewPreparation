# Scalable Hierarchical Forwarding Information Base: Complete Design

## Understanding the Fundamental Challenge

When you're building a router that needs to handle millions of routes from multiple routing protocols—BGP bringing in internet routes, OSPF managing your internal network, static routes for specific configurations, L3VPN routes for customer traffic, and MPLS paths for traffic engineering—you face a critical architectural decision. How do you organize this information in a way that scales to millions of entries, converges quickly when the network changes, and doesn't waste memory by duplicating the same information repeatedly?

Consider a real-world scenario. You have ten thousand BGP routes, all using the same BGP next-hop address. That BGP next-hop is itself learned through IGP (like OSPF), which resolves to a specific physical interface and MAC address. In a naive implementation, you might store the complete path information—IGP route, physical interface, MAC address—separately for each of those ten thousand BGP routes. This approach doesn't scale. When the MAC address changes or the IGP route updates, you'd need to update ten thousand entries. The memory overhead becomes prohibitive, and convergence time grows linearly with the number of dependent routes.

## The Hierarchical Solution: Separation of Concerns

The hierarchical Forwarding Information Base solves this problem through indirection and layering. Instead of each route containing complete forwarding information, routes point to intermediate resolution objects, which in turn point to more concrete forwarding actions. This creates a hierarchy of dependencies where information is shared maximally and updates propagate efficiently.

Think of it like a corporate organization chart. The CEO doesn't directly manage every employee. There are layers—executives, directors, managers—and when a policy changes at one level, it cascades down through the hierarchy without the CEO needing to individually inform each person. Similarly, when a physical interface goes down, the routes don't all need individual updates. The shared resolution object updates once, and that change is automatically reflected for all routes using it.

## Core Architecture Components

The system consists of several fundamental building blocks that work together. Each building block represents one level in the hierarchy and has a specific responsibility. Let me walk you through each component and how they interconnect.

### The Route Entry: Where It All Begins

A route entry represents a destination prefix that the router knows how to reach. This could be an IPv4 prefix like 10.0.0.0/8, an IPv6 prefix, an MPLS label, or a VPN route. The route entry doesn't contain detailed forwarding information. Instead, it contains a reference to a Resolution Object that knows how to reach this destination.

Here's how we model this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/* 
 * Address family types - supporting multiple protocol families
 * This makes our FIB truly generic across all routing protocols
 */
typedef enum {
    ADDRESS_FAMILY_IPV4 = 1,
    ADDRESS_FAMILY_IPV6 = 2,
    ADDRESS_FAMILY_MPLS = 3,
    ADDRESS_FAMILY_L2VPN = 4,
    ADDRESS_FAMILY_L3VPN_IPV4 = 5,
    ADDRESS_FAMILY_L3VPN_IPV6 = 6
} address_family_t;

/*
 * Types of resolution objects in our hierarchy
 * Each type represents a different level of indirection
 */
typedef enum {
    RESOLUTION_TYPE_INVALID = 0,
    RESOLUTION_TYPE_DIRECT_NEXTHOP,      /* Directly connected */
    RESOLUTION_TYPE_INDIRECT_NEXTHOP,    /* Needs recursive resolution */
    RESOLUTION_TYPE_ECMP_GROUP,          /* Equal cost multipath */
    RESOLUTION_TYPE_LABEL_STACK,         /* MPLS label operations */
    RESOLUTION_TYPE_TUNNEL,              /* Tunnel encapsulation */
    RESOLUTION_TYPE_VPN_NEXTHOP          /* VPN-specific forwarding */
} resolution_type_t;

/*
 * The RouteEntry is the top of our hierarchy.
 * It represents a prefix that the router knows how to forward.
 * 
 * Key insight: The route entry is protocol-agnostic. Whether this came
 * from BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, or a static route doesn't matter at this level.
 * What matters is the destination prefix and how to resolve it.
 */
typedef struct RouteEntry {
    /* Prefix information */
    address_family_t address_family;
    uint8_t prefix_data[16];      /* Enough for IPv6 */
    uint8_t prefix_length;
    
    /* Administrative data */
    uint32_t route_id;            /* Unique identifier for this route */
    uint8_t protocol;             /* BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, static, etc. */
    uint32_t preference;          /* Administrative distance */
    uint32_t metric;              /* Route metric */
    
    /*
     * This is the critical part: instead of storing complete forwarding
     * information, we store a reference to a resolution object.
     * This creates the first level of hierarchy.
     */
    resolution_type_t resolution_type;
    uint32_t resolution_index;    /* Index into the resolution object table */
    
    /* Metadata for tracking and management */
    bool is_active;               /* Is this route currently active in FIB? */
    uint64_t install_timestamp;   /* When was this route installed */
    uint32_t reference_count;     /* How many entities depend on this route */
} RouteEntry;

/*
 * Initialize a route entry with basic information
 * This function shows how we create a route that points to a resolution object
 */
void route_entry_init(RouteEntry *route, 
                      address_family_t family,
                      const uint8_t *prefix,
                      uint8_t prefix_len,
                      uint8_t protocol,
                      resolution_type_t res_type,
                      uint32_t res_index) {
    route->address_family = family;
    memcpy(route->prefix_data, prefix, (family == ADDRESS_FAMILY_IPV6) ? 16 : 4);
    route->prefix_length = prefix_len;
    route->protocol = protocol;
    route->resolution_type = res_type;
    route->resolution_index = res_index;
    route->is_active = false;
    route->reference_count = 0;
}
```

Notice what we're NOT storing in the RouteEntry. We're not storing MAC addresses, physical interfaces, MPLS labels, or any concrete forwarding actions. The route simply says "I need to be resolved through object X of type Y." This is the foundation of scalability.

### The Resolution Object: The Heart of Hierarchy

The Resolution Object is where the magic happens. This is the intermediate layer that can represent different types of forwarding decisions. A Resolution Object might represent a single next-hop address that needs further resolution, an ECMP group with multiple paths, a label stack for MPLS forwarding, or a tunnel endpoint.

The beauty of this design is that multiple routes can share the same Resolution Object. If you have one hundred thousand internet routes all using the same BGP next-hop, they all point to the same Resolution Object. When that next-hop changes, you update one Resolution Object, not one hundred thousand routes.

```c
/*
 * The ResolutionObject is the intermediate layer in our hierarchy.
 * It represents "how" to forward traffic, abstracting away the details.
 * 
 * Think of this as a forwarding instruction that can be shared by
 * many routes. This sharing is what makes the system scalable.
 */
typedef struct ResolutionObject {
    uint32_t resolution_id;       /* Unique identifier */
    resolution_type_t type;       /* What kind of resolution is this? */
    
    /*
     * The recursive pointer: if this resolution object itself needs
     * to be resolved through another object, we chain them here.
     * This creates the hierarchy: Route -> ResolutionA -> ResolutionB -> NextHop
     */
    bool needs_recursion;
    resolution_type_t next_resolution_type;
    uint32_t next_resolution_index;
    
    /* 
     * Union to hold type-specific data. This makes our structure
     * memory-efficient while supporting different forwarding types.
     */
    union {
        struct {
            uint8_t next_hop_address[16];  /* IP address to recurse through */
            address_family_t address_family;
        } indirect;
        
        struct {
            uint32_t group_id;
            uint32_t member_count;
            uint32_t *member_indices;      /* Array of resolution indices */
        } ecmp;
        
        struct {
            uint32_t label_count;

            uint32_t next_hop_index;       /* What to do after label push */
        } label_stack;
        
        struct {
            uint32_t tunnel_id;
            uint8_t tunnel_type;
            uint32_t inner_resolution_index;  /* How to forward inside tunnel */
        } tunnel;
    } data;
    
    /* State tracking */
    bool is_resolved;             /* Is this object fully resolved? */
    uint32_t reference_count;     /* How many routes use this? */
    uint64_t last_update_time;    /* When was this last modified? */
    
    /*
     * Hardware programming state. The FIB might be programmed into
     * hardware (ASIC), and we need to track the hardware resources.
     */
    bool is_programmed_in_hardware;

} ResolutionObject;

/*
 * Create an indirect resolution object that recurses through an IP address
 * This is commonly used for BGP routes that recurse through BGP next-hop
 */
ResolutionObject* create_indirect_resolution(uint8_t *next_hop_address, 
                                             address_family_t family) {

    memcpy(obj->data.indirect.next_hop_address, next_hop_address, addr_size);
    
    return obj;
}

/*
 * Create an ECMP group resolution object

 */

                                        uint32_t member_count) {

    memcpy(obj->data.ecmp.member_indices, member_indices, sizeof(uint32_t) * member_count);
    
    return obj;
}
```

### The Direct NextHop: Where Hierarchy Ends

At the bottom of our hierarchy sits the Direct NextHop. This is where the recursion stops and we have concrete forwarding information. A Direct NextHop contains the layer 2 rewrite information (destination MAC address, VLAN tags), the egress interface, and any final packet transformations needed.

```c
/*
 * The DirectNextHop is the terminal node in our hierarchy.
 * This contains the actual physical forwarding information needed
 * to transmit a packet out of the router.
 * 
 * This is where "virtual" forwarding decisions become "physical" actions.
 */
typedef struct DirectNextHop {
    uint32_t nexthop_id;          /* Unique identifier */
    
    /* Layer 2 rewrite information */
    uint8_t destination_mac[6];   /* MAC address to rewrite to */
    uint8_t source_mac[6];        /* Our MAC address */
    uint16_t vlan_id;             /* VLAN tag (0 if untagged) */
    bool is_vlan_tagged;
    
    /* Physical egress information */
    uint32_t egress_interface_id; /* Which physical port */
    uint32_t egress_port_number;  /* Port number for hardware */
    
    /* State information */
    bool is_reachable;            /* Is this next-hop currently reachable? */
    uint64_t last_arp_refresh;    /* When did we last verify MAC address? */
    uint32_t reference_count;     /* How many resolution objects use this? */
    
    /* Hardware resources */
    bool is_programmed_in_hardware;
    uint32_t hardware_adjacency_id;  /* Hardware adjacency entry */
} DirectNextHop;

/*
 * Create a direct next-hop with complete L2 rewrite information
 * This function demonstrates how we create the terminal forwarding action
 */
DirectNextHop* create_direct_nexthop(uint8_t *dest_mac,
                                     uint8_t *source_mac,
                                     uint32_t interface_id,
                                     uint16_t vlan) {
    DirectNextHop *nh = (DirectNextHop*)malloc(sizeof(DirectNextHop));
    if (!nh) return NULL;
    
    memcpy(nh->destination_mac, dest_mac, 6);
    memcpy(nh->source_mac, source_mac, 6);
    nh->egress_interface_id = interface_id;
    nh->vlan_id = vlan;
    nh->is_vlan_tagged = (vlan != 0);
    nh->is_reachable = true;
    nh->reference_count = 0;
    nh->is_programmed_in_hardware = false;
    
    return nh;
}
```

## How Hierarchy Enables Massive Scale

Let me show you why this hierarchical design scales to millions of routes while naive flat designs fail. Consider a real-world BGP routing table with one million IPv4 prefixes. In a typical internet router, many of these prefixes share next-hops. You might have only ten thousand unique BGP next-hop addresses for those one million prefixes.

With our hierarchical design, we create one million RouteEntry objects (lightweight, just the prefix and a pointer). We create ten thousand ResolutionObject entries for the unique BGP next-hops. Those ten thousand ResolutionObjects might resolve through only a few hundred unique IGP routes. And those few hundred IGP routes might resolve to perhaps fifty directly connected next-hops.

So we've structured one million routes using approximately:
- One million RouteEntry objects (small, maybe 64 bytes each = 64 MB)
- Ten thousand ResolutionObject entries (medium, maybe 128 bytes each = 1.3 MB)
- Five hundred IGP ResolutionObjects (128 bytes each = 64 KB)
- Fifty DirectNextHop objects (large, maybe 256 bytes each = 13 KB)

Total memory: approximately 65.4 MB. Compare this to a flat design where each route stores complete forwarding information: one million routes times 256 bytes equals 256 MB, nearly four times more memory. But memory savings is just one benefit.

## Convergence: The Real Power of Hierarchy

The true power of hierarchical FIB reveals itself during network events. Imagine an interface goes down. That interface has a specific MAC address that was being used by one of your fifty DirectNextHop objects. In our hierarchical design, you mark that one DirectNextHop as unreachable. That change automatically affects the few hundred IGP routes using it, which automatically affects the ten thousand BGP next-hops, which automatically affects the one million internet routes.

You updated one object, and the effect cascaded through the hierarchy. No need to iterate through one million routes. No need to reprogram one million hardware entries. The hierarchy contained the update to the affected layers.

Let me show you how this works in code:

```c
/*
 * The ForwardingInformationBase ties everything together.
 * This is the main data structure that manages our hierarchy.
 */
typedef struct ForwardingInformationBase {
    /* Route tables indexed by address family */
    RouteEntry **ipv4_routes;
    uint32_t ipv4_route_count;
    uint32_t ipv4_route_capacity;
    
    RouteEntry **ipv6_routes;
    uint32_t ipv6_route_count;
    uint32_t ipv6_route_capacity;
    
    /* Resolution object pool - shared across all routes */
    ResolutionObject **resolution_objects;
    uint32_t resolution_count;
    uint32_t resolution_capacity;
    
    /* Direct next-hop pool - the bottom of our hierarchy */
    DirectNextHop **direct_nexthops;
    uint32_t nexthop_count;
    uint32_t nexthop_capacity;
    
    /* Statistics for monitoring scale */
    uint64_t total_routes_installed;
    uint64_t total_updates_processed;
    uint64_t memory_bytes_used;
} ForwardingInformationBase;

/*
 * When a direct next-hop becomes unreachable, we need to propagate
 * this information up through the hierarchy. This is called a
 * "dependent walk" - we walk through all objects that depend on
 * this next-hop and mark them as needing resolution.
 */
void propagate_nexthop_unreachable(ForwardingInformationBase *fib,
                                   uint32_t nexthop_id) {
    DirectNextHop *nh = fib->direct_nexthops[nexthop_id];
    if (!nh) return;
    
    /* Step 1: Mark the next-hop as unreachable */
    nh->is_reachable = false;
    
    /*
     * Step 2: Find all resolution objects that use this next-hop.
     * In a production system, we'd maintain reverse pointers for efficiency.
     * For educational purposes, we'll show the conceptual approach.
     */
    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < fib->resolution_count; i++) {
        ResolutionObject *res = fib->resolution_objects[i];
        if (!res) continue;
        
        /* Check if this resolution object uses our affected next-hop */
        bool uses_affected_nexthop = false;
        
        if (res->type == RESOLUTION_TYPE_DIRECT_NEXTHOP) {
            /* This resolution points directly to a next-hop */
            if (res->next_resolution_index == nexthop_id) {
                uses_affected_nexthop = true;
            }
        } else if (res->type == RESOLUTION_TYPE_ECMP_GROUP) {
            /* Check if any ECMP member uses this next-hop */
            for (uint32_t j = 0; j < res->data.ecmp.member_count; j++) {
                /* In reality, we'd recurse through the member resolution */
                /* Simplified here for clarity */
            }
        }
        
        if (uses_affected_nexthop) {
            res->is_resolved = false;
            
            /*
             * Step 3: The resolution object is now unresolved, which means
             * all routes using it need to be aware. But here's the key:
             * we don't need to update those routes individually.
             * When they try to forward, they'll check the resolution object
             * and see it's unresolved. Or, we can mark them for recomputation
             * in batch.
             */
        }
    }
    
    /*
     * In a sophisticated implementation, we'd trigger:
     * 1. Hardware deprogramming of affected entries
     * 2. Triggering of alternate path computation
     * 3. Notification to routing protocols for convergence
     * 
     * But all of this happens at the resolution layer, not at individual routes.
     * This is what makes convergence fast even with millions of routes.
     */
}
```

This is the fundamental architecture. The hierarchy allows us to share common information maximally, update efficiently during network events, and scale to millions of routes across all routing protocols. Whether a route comes from BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, or a static configuration doesn't matter. They all use the same hierarchical resolution mechanism, making the FIB truly protocol-agnostic and scalable.

# Forward Walk and Dependent Walk: Navigation Through Hierarchical FIB

## Why Walking Matters

When you build a hierarchical system like our Forwarding Information Base, you create two fundamental problems that don't exist in flat designs. The first problem is assembly: when it's time to actually forward a packet or program hardware, you need to gather all the pieces of information scattered across different hierarchy levels and assemble them into a complete forwarding action. The second problem is propagation: when something changes at one level of the hierarchy, you need to notify all the dependent objects at higher levels so they can react appropriately.

These two problems require two different types of traversal through our hierarchy. We call them Forward Walk and Dependent Walk. Understanding these walks is absolutely critical because they determine both the performance of your packet forwarding and the speed of your network convergence. Get them wrong, and your elegant hierarchy becomes a performance bottleneck. Get them right, and you unlock the full potential of hierarchical design.

## Forward Walk: Assembling the Complete Picture

Imagine you're a hardware abstraction layer that needs to program an ASIC chip with forwarding rules. You receive a RouteEntry object that says "forward traffic for prefix 10.1.0.0/16 using ResolutionObject 42." That's not enough information to program hardware. You need to know the complete chain: what does ResolutionObject 42 point to? If it points to another resolution object, what does that point to? Eventually you need to reach a DirectNextHop that has actual MAC addresses, VLAN tags, and physical port numbers.

Forward Walk is the process of traversing down through the hierarchy, following the chain of resolution pointers, collecting information at each level, until you reach the terminal forwarding action. Think of it like following a treasure map where each location gives you a clue to the next location, and you collect items along the way. At the end, you have everything you need.

Let me show you how Forward Walk works with detailed code:

```c

Forward Walk is straightforward conceptually—we're just following pointers down the hierarchy. But it's absolutely essential for two operations. First, when we need to program hardware with forwarding rules, we must perform a Forward Walk to gather all the necessary information. Second, when we need to verify that a route is fully resolved and ready to forward traffic, we perform a Forward Walk to check that every link in the chain is valid.

## Dependent Walk: Propagating Change Through the Hierarchy

Now let's tackle the harder problem: Dependent Walk. This is where the hierarchy earns its keep in terms of convergence performance. When something changes at a lower level of the hierarchy, we need to notify all the objects at higher levels that depend on the changed object. But here's the complexity: we don't want to notify everything. We only want to notify the objects that are actually affected. And we want to do it efficiently, without scanning through millions of routes.

The key insight is that we maintain reverse dependencies. Each object in the hierarchy keeps track of which objects depend on it. When an object changes, it walks its list of dependents and notifies them. Those dependents might then notify their dependents, creating a wave of updates that propagates upward through the hierarchy.

But there's a catch. Different hardware platforms need different update strategies. Some platforms can reprogram forwarding entries in place. Others need a "make before break" approach where you create new entries before deleting old ones. Some platforms only need to be notified about certain types of changes. This means our Dependent Walk needs to be flexible and configurable.

```

The real power of Dependent Walk becomes clear in failure scenarios. Imagine an interface goes down. That interface was being used by a DirectNextHop. The DirectNextHop has perhaps five ResolutionObjects depending on it (five different IGP routes). Each of those five ResolutionObjects has perhaps two thousand BGP next-hops depending on it (ten thousand total). And those ten thousand BGP next-hops have a total of one million routes depending on them.

With Dependent Walk, we don't iterate through one million routes. We mark the one DirectNextHop as down. We walk to the five ResolutionObjects and mark them as unresolved. We walk to the ten thousand BGP next-hops and mark them as unresolved. And we're done. When a route tries to forward a packet, it checks its resolution object, sees it's unresolved, and can immediately drop or redirect the packet. We've achieved convergence awareness across one million routes with just ten thousand operations.

## Make Before Break: Critical for Hardware

There's one more crucial aspect of walks that we must address: hardware resource management. When you're programming physical ASIC chips, you can't just delete an old forwarding entry and create a new one atomically. There's a window where packets might arrive and have no forwarding entry. This causes packet loss during convergence, which is unacceptable for carrier-grade networks.

The solution is Make Before Break. When something changes, you first create the new hardware entry, then update all dependents to point to the new entry, and only after all dependents have switched do you delete the old entry. This requires careful coordination in your walk algorithms.

```c
/*
 * Perform a hardware update with make-before-break semantics.
 * This function shows how dependent walk integrates with hardware programming.
 */
bool hardware_update_make_before_break(void *node,
                                      node_type_t node_type,

    /*

                                                        hardware_abstraction);
    
    if (new_hw_handle == 0) {

    set_hardware_handle(node, node_type, new_hw_handle);
    
    /*
     * Step 4: Walk all dependents and tell them to update their hardware
     * entries to use the new handle instead of the old one
     */
    DependentList *deps = get_dependent_list(node, node_type);
    
    DependentWalkNotification notification = {
        .changed_node_type = node_type,
        .changed_node_index = get_node_index(node, node_type),
        .change_type = CHANGE_TYPE_MODIFIED,
        .old_hardware_handle = old_hw_handle,
        .new_hardware_handle = new_hw_handle,
        .requires_hardware_update = true,
        .strategy = WALK_STRATEGY_HARDWARE_ONLY,
        .max_levels = 100  /* Walk as far as needed */
    };
    
    perform_dependent_walk(node, node_type, deps, &notification, fib_database);
    
    /*
     * Step 5: Only after all dependents have been updated can we safely
     * delete the old hardware entry. This is the "break" part of
     * make-before-break.
     */
    delete_hardware_entry(old_hw_handle, hardware_abstraction);
    
    printf("Make-before-break hardware update completed successfully\n");
    return true;
}
```

Make Before Break combined with Dependent Walk gives us hitless convergence even with millions of routes. The old forwarding entries stay valid until every dependent has moved to the new entries. No packet loss, no black holes, just smooth transition from old state to new state.

This is why Walk algorithms are not just an implementation detail. They are fundamental to achieving the scale and convergence goals that drove us to hierarchical FIB in the first place. Forward Walk lets us efficiently program hardware. Dependent Walk lets us efficiently handle changes. Together, they make the hierarchy practical for real-world, carrier-scale networks.

# ECMP in Hierarchical FIB: Load Balancing Across Multiple Paths

## The Problem ECMP Solves

Imagine you're operating a data center network where you have multiple equal-cost paths between any two points. This is standard practice for modern networks because it provides both redundancy and increased aggregate bandwidth. When a packet needs to travel from point A to point B, and there are four equally good paths, you want to distribute traffic across all four paths rather than using just one and leaving the other three idle. This traffic distribution is called Equal Cost Multi-Path, or ECMP.

In a flat forwarding table design, implementing ECMP is relatively straightforward but wasteful. You might have a single routing entry that points to four different next-hops, and you replicate this structure for every route that needs ECMP. But when you move to hierarchical FIB where routes share resolution objects to save memory and improve convergence, ECMP becomes more interesting. You need to support ECMP at multiple levels of the hierarchy, and you need to handle the case where different routes might share some ECMP paths but not others.

## ECMP at Different Hierarchy Levels

The beauty of hierarchical FIB is that ECMP can occur at any level of the resolution chain, and the levels compose naturally. You might have a BGP route that resolves to a single BGP next-hop address. That BGP next-hop address might be reachable via ECMP through the IGP, giving you multiple physical paths. Or you might have a BGP route that itself has multiple BGP next-hops (BGP multipath), and each of those next-hops might resolve through IGP with its own ECMP. The hierarchy handles this composition elegantly.

Let me show you how we model ECMP in our hierarchical structure:

```c

#include <stdlib.h>

Now here's where it gets interesting. When you create an ECMP group in hierarchical FIB, each member of the group is not a complete forwarding specification. Each member is just a reference to another resolution object. That resolution object might be a direct next-hop, but it might also be another ECMP group, or a label operation, or an indirect resolution that needs further lookup. The hierarchy naturally supports nested ECMP and complex topologies.

## Hash-Based Member Selection

For ECMP to be useful, we need to consistently map each packet flow to the same member path. If packets from the same TCP connection took different paths, they could arrive out of order, causing performance problems. The solution is to use a hash function that takes packet header fields and produces a consistent member index.

The hash function needs to be fast because it runs in the data plane for every packet, and it needs to distribute flows evenly across members. Most hardware uses specialized hash circuits, but conceptually the algorithm works like this:

```c
/*
 * Simplified packet header structure for hashing purposes.
 * In reality, you'd pull these fields from the actual packet.
 */
typedef struct PacketFlowInfo {
    uint32_t source_ip;
    uint32_t destination_ip;
    uint16_t source_port;
    uint16_t destination_port;
    uint8_t protocol;
    uint32_t flow_label;      /* IPv6 flow label */
    uint32_t mpls_label;      /* Top MPLS label */
} PacketFlowInfo;

/*
 * Hash function for ECMP member selection.
 * This is a simplified version; production systems use more sophisticated
 * hashing algorithms optimized for hardware implementation.
 *
 * The key property is that the same flow always produces the same hash,
 * so packets from one TCP connection always go to the same member.
 */
uint32_t ecmp_compute_hash(PacketFlowInfo *flow, ECMPGroup *group) {
    uint32_t hash = 0;
    
    switch (group->hash_mode) {
        case ECMP_HASH_L3:
            /* Hash only IP addresses */
            hash = flow->source_ip ^ flow->destination_ip;
            break;

## Member Failure and Dynamic Rebalancing

One of the trickiest aspects of ECMP in a hierarchical system is handling member failures. When one member of an ECMP group goes down, we need to redistribute its traffic across the remaining members. But we want to minimize disruption to flows that were using other members. This is called "minimal disruption" or "consistent hashing."

The naive approach of simple modulo mapping has a problem. If you have eight members and one fails, dropping you to seven members, the hash modulo changes for almost all flows. A flow that was going to member three might now go to member six. This causes flow reordering and can break stateful protocols.

Better approaches use consistent hashing or resilient hashing algorithms that minimize the number of flows that need to move when membership changes. Let me show you a more sophisticated approach:

```c
/*
 * Resilient hashing table for minimal disruption during member changes.
 * Instead of simple modulo, we maintain a table that maps hash values
 * to members, and we only update table entries for failed members.
 */
typedef struct ResilientHashTable {
    uint32_t *member_mapping;     /* Maps hash value to member index */
    uint32_t table_size;          /* Size of mapping table (power of 2) */
    uint32_t member_count;        /* Number of members */
} ResilientHashTable;

/*
 * Create a resilient hash table for an ECMP group.
 * The table size should be much larger than member count for good distribution.
 */
ResilientHashTable* create_resilient_hash_table(uint32_t member_count) {
    ResilientHashTable *table = (ResilientHashTable*)malloc(sizeof(ResilientHashTable));
    
    /* Use a table size that's a power of 2 and at least 64x member count */
    table->table_size = 1;
    while (table->table_size < member_count * 64) {
        table->table_size *= 2;
    }
    
    table->member_mapping = (uint32_t*)malloc(sizeof(uint32_t) * table->table_size);
    table->member_count = member_count;
    
    /* Initially distribute table entries evenly across members */
    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < table->table_size; i++) {
        table->member_mapping[i] = i % member_count;
    }
    
    return table;
}

    }

This resilient hashing approach means that when a member fails, only the flows that were using that member get redistributed. All other flows continue to use their existing members. This minimizes disruption and maintains connection state better.

## ECMP in Multi-Level Hierarchies

Now let's see how ECMP works when it appears at multiple levels of the hierarchy. Consider a BGP route that has multipath enabled, giving you ECMP at the BGP level. Each BGP path resolves through IGP, and IGP itself might have ECMP to reach each BGP next-hop. You end up with nested ECMP, and the total number of physical paths is the product of ECMP fan-out at each level.

```c
/*
 * Demonstrate nested ECMP resolution through multiple hierarchy levels.
 * This shows a BGP route with 2-way ECMP, where each BGP next-hop
 * has 4-way ECMP at the IGP level, giving 8 total paths.

        get_id(bgp_ecmp)
    );
    
    printf("\nTotal forwarding paths: 2 (BGP) × 4 (IGP) = 8 physical paths\n");
    printf("Traffic will be distributed across all 8 paths based on flow hash\n");
    
    /*

     * Only 1/8th of traffic is affected.

    printf("Total active paths: (1×3) + (1×4) = 7 paths\n");
    printf("Only flows using the failed path need to redistribute\n");
    printf("Approximately 1/8th of traffic affected, not the full route\n");
}
```

This nested ECMP is powerful. When a single physical path fails deep in the hierarchy, only a fraction of the total flows are affected. The hierarchy naturally contains the impact of failures to the affected portion of the tree. A route with eight physical paths through nested ECMP has better fault tolerance than a route with a single path, but it also has better granularity of failure impact than a flat ECMP with eight members.

## Per-Flow vs Per-Packet Load Balancing

One final consideration for ECMP is the granularity of load balancing. Most ECMP implementations use per-flow load balancing, where all packets in a TCP connection follow the same path. This prevents packet reordering but means that a few large flows can create load imbalance. Some advanced systems support per-packet load balancing for non-reorderable traffic like IP multicast or UDP traffic that doesn't care about order.

In hierarchical FIB, you can mix both approaches at different levels. You might do per-flow balancing at the BGP level to keep customer flows consistent, but do per-packet balancing at the physical link level where you have link aggregation. The hierarchy gives you this flexibility because each ECMP group can have its own load balancing policy.

The key insight is that ECMP in hierarchical FIB is not just about distributing load. It's about composability, minimal disruption during failures, and efficient sharing of ECMP groups across multiple routes. When you have ten thousand routes that all use the same four-way ECMP at the IGP level, you don't create ten thousand copies of that ECMP group. You create one ECMP group and have all ten thousand routes reference it. This is the essence of hierarchical design: maximum sharing, minimal duplication, and efficient convergence.

# MPLS Label Operations: Separation from Layer 2 Rewrite

## Understanding the Fundamental Split

When you build a router that handles MPLS traffic, you face an architectural choice that has profound implications for scalability and flexibility. In MPLS forwarding, two conceptually different operations happen to every packet. First, you manipulate the MPLS label stack by pushing new labels, swapping existing labels, or popping labels off. Second, you perform layer 2 rewriting by changing MAC addresses and sending the packet out a specific physical interface. These are distinct operations serving different purposes, yet in many traditional implementations they were bundled together into a single monolithic structure.

Think about why this bundling causes problems. Imagine you have a thousand different label switched paths, each pushing a different MPLS label, but all of them exiting through the same physical interface to the same next-hop router. In a bundled design, you would store the layer 2 rewrite information—the destination MAC address, source MAC address, VLAN tag, and egress port—separately for each of those thousand label operations. That's a thousand copies of identical layer 2 information. When the MAC address of the next-hop router changes (which happens whenever ARP refreshes or the interface resets), you need to update a thousand entries. This doesn't scale, and it makes convergence slow.

The solution is separation. We split label operations from layer 2 rewrite into distinct entities that can be independently created, modified, and shared. A label operation entity knows only about labels: which labels to push, in what order, and what to do next. A layer 2 rewrite entity knows only about the physical forwarding: MAC addresses, VLAN tags, and egress interfaces. These entities link together through our standard hierarchy mechanism using resolution pointers, but they remain separate and independently manageable.

## Modeling Label Operations as Resolution Objects

In our hierarchical FIB architecture, label operations become just another type of resolution object. They sit in the middle of the resolution chain, typically between a route and the final direct next-hop. This placement makes sense conceptually: the route determines where traffic should go (the destination), label operations determine how to encode that destination in MPLS (the encapsulation), and the direct next-hop determines the physical transmission (the link layer).

Let me show you how we model this:

Notice what's missing from the LabelOperation structure. There's no MAC address, no VLAN tag, no physical interface identifier. The label operation is purely concerned with MPLS encapsulation. It points to a next resolution object through the standard hierarchy mechanism, and that next object (typically a direct next-hop) handles the layer 2 concerns.

## The Power of Separation: Sharing and Efficiency

The true benefit of this separation becomes apparent when you consider real-world MPLS deployments. In a service provider network running L3VPN services, you might have thousands of customer routes, each needing a different VPN label pushed. But all those customer routes going to the same remote PE router will ultimately use the same transport path and the same layer 2 rewrite.

With separation, you create thousands of label operation objects (one per VPN route, each with a different label), but you create only one direct next-hop object for the shared transport path. When the transport path changes—maybe the MAC address updates or the physical interface switches to a backup—you update one direct next-hop object, and all thousands of label operations automatically inherit that change through the hierarchy.

Let me show you this sharing in action:

```c
/*
 * Demonstrate label operation sharing in an L3VPN scenario.
 * Multiple customer VPN routes share the same transport infrastructure.

    DirectNextHop *transport_nh = create_direct_nexthop(

    for (int i = 0; i < vpn_route_count; i++) {
        /* Each VPN route gets a unique label (starting from 100000) */

    printf("Transport next-hop MAC address changed\n");
    printf("  New MAC: %02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x\n",

    /*
     * The beauty: we updated ONE object, but the effect cascades to

     * and they should reprogram hardware if needed.
     */
}
```

This example illustrates the core benefit. We created a thousand label operations but only one next-hop. When the next-hop changes, we perform one update operation, not a thousand. This is a thousand-fold reduction in convergence time for this scenario. In real networks with hundreds of thousands of VPN routes, the savings are even more dramatic.

## Multi-Level Label Stacks: Hierarchical MPLS

MPLS becomes even more interesting when you have multiple levels of hierarchy in the label stack itself. Consider traffic engineering combined with L3VPN. You have a VPN label that identifies the customer VPN, and you have a transport label (or tunnel label) that specifies the traffic-engineered path through the network. The VPN label goes deeper in the stack, and the transport label goes on top.

In hierarchical FIB, we model this as two separate label operation objects chained together. The route points to the VPN label operation, which in turn points to the transport label operation, which finally points to the direct next-hop. This chaining naturally expresses the layering of MPLS label stacks.

```c
/*
 * Demonstrate multi-level MPLS label hierarchy for L3VPN over TE.
 * This shows VPN label + TE tunnel label + physical forwarding.

The hierarchical approach to MPLS label stacks mirrors the hierarchical approach to routing resolution. Each layer is independent and separately manageable. When something changes at one layer, the impact is contained to that layer and its immediate dependents. You don't need to ripple updates through unrelated layers.

## Hardware Programming Implications

When you separate label operations from layer 2 rewrite, you also change how you program hardware. Modern ASICs typically have separate tables for egress encapsulation (where labels live) and egress L2 rewrite (where MAC addresses live). The hardware architecture naturally mirrors the software separation we've designed.

In a typical ASIC, you might program a label operation as an EEDB (Egress Encapsulation Database) entry that says "push these labels and then chain to L2 rewrite entry X." The L2 rewrite entry says "rewrite with these MAC addresses, add this VLAN tag, and send out port Y." The chaining in hardware matches the chaining in our software hierarchy through resolution pointers.

This alignment between software structure and hardware capabilities is not accidental. The separation we've designed enables efficient hardware programming because it matches how hardware works. When a MAC address changes, you reprogram one L2 rewrite entry in hardware. All the EEDB entries that chain to it automatically use the new MAC address without needing reprogramming. The hardware naturally supports the sharing and efficiency we designed into software.

The lesson here is that architectural decisions in software have direct consequences for hardware efficiency. By separating label operations from layer 2 rewrite in our data structures, we enable efficient hardware implementation, fast convergence, and maximal resource sharing. This is not just an abstract software principle. It has concrete performance benefits in real networks carrying real traffic.

# Recursive NextHop: The Foundation of Multi-Level Hierarchies

## Why Recursion Matters in Routing

When you first learn about routing, you encounter the concept of a next-hop: the router sends a packet to a next-hop IP address, which is typically a directly connected neighbor. This works perfectly for simple networks where all destinations are either directly connected or reachable through one directly connected router. But real networks are not this simple. In real networks, especially in service provider and large enterprise environments, you frequently encounter situations where the next-hop itself is not directly reachable. The next-hop needs to be resolved through another route, which might need to be resolved through yet another route. This is recursive resolution, and it's absolutely fundamental to scalable routing.

Consider BGP in a typical service provider network. You receive a BGP route with a next-hop IP address that belongs to a remote router, perhaps hundreds of miles away. That BGP next-hop is not directly connected to you. To reach it, you need to consult your IGP routing table (OSPF or IS-IS) to find out how to reach that BGP next-hop address. The IGP might tell you that the BGP next-hop is reachable via another IP address, which itself might be learned through IGP and eventually resolved to a directly connected next-hop. This chain of resolution from BGP route to IGP route to directly connected interface is what we call recursive resolution.

The critical insight is that this recursion creates natural hierarchy in routing. BGP routes form one layer. IGP routes form another layer. Directly connected routes form the bottom layer. Each layer resolves through the layer below it. If we can model this hierarchy explicitly in our data structures, we gain enormous benefits in scalability and convergence. This is exactly what Recursive NextHop enables.

## Modeling Recursive Resolution

In our hierarchical FIB architecture, we introduce a special type of resolution object called a Recursive NextHop. This object represents an IP address that needs to be looked up in the routing table to determine how to actually reach it. The Recursive NextHop is the glue that links different levels of hierarchy together. When a route points to a Recursive NextHop, it's saying "I don't know the complete forwarding path yet. First, resolve this IP address, then follow whatever that resolution leads to."

The power of this approach is that the upper layer (like BGP) doesn't need to know anything about the lower layer (like IGP). BGP just says "forward to IP address 10.0.0.1" and the Recursive NextHop mechanism handles finding out how to actually reach 10.0.0.1. When the IGP path to 10.0.0.1 changes, the BGP route doesn't need to be touched. The change is isolated to the IGP layer, and it automatically affects all routes recursing through that address.

The resolution process is straightforward conceptually but has important subtleties. When we resolve a Recursive NextHop, we're essentially performing a routing table lookup and caching the result. But we need to be careful about several things: recursion loops, changing routing tables, and maintaining correct dependencies.

## Three-Level Hierarchy: A Real-World Example

Let me show you a concrete example that appears frequently in service provider networks: L3VPN routes that recurse through BGP next-hops, which themselves recurse through IGP routes. This creates a three-level hierarchy, and it demonstrates why recursive resolution is so powerful.

In this scenario, you have a customer VPN route like 192.168.1.0/24 in VRF "CustomerA". This route was learned via BGP from a remote PE router. The BGP next-hop for this route is the loopback address of the remote PE, say 10.255.0.5. But 10.255.0.5 is not directly connected to you. It's learned through your IGP (OSPF or IS-IS). The IGP tells you that 10.255.0.5 is reachable through your directly connected neighbor 10.1.1.2. So we have three levels:

Level 1 (Top): VPN route 192.168.1.0/24 → recurses through 10.255.0.5
Level 2 (Middle): BGP next-hop 10.255.0.5 → recurses through IGP
Level 3 (Bottom): IGP route → resolves to directly connected 10.1.1.2

    printf("New interface: GigabitEthernet 0/0/4\n");
    printf("New MAC: %02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x\n\n",

    printf("  - Change contained to IGP layer\n");
    printf("  - All VPN routes using this BGP NH automatically updated\n");

```

This example shows the real power of recursive resolution. When the IGP path changes, we don't touch the VPN route. We don't touch the label operation. We only update the IGP route, and the recursive next-hop automatically picks up the new resolution. If you have ten thousand VPN routes all using the same BGP next-hop, they all automatically get updated when the IGP changes, without needing any individual updates.

## Handling Recursive NextHop Changes

The tricky part of recursive next-hops is handling changes correctly. When the route that a recursive next-hop resolves through changes, we need to:

1. Re-resolve the recursive next-hop to update its cached resolution
2. Notify all dependents (routes using this recursive next-hop) about the change
3. Reprogram hardware if necessary
4. Handle the case where the recursive address becomes unreachable

This is where dependent walk becomes critical. The routing table maintains a reverse dependency: for each route, it tracks which recursive next-hops depend on it. When a route changes, it walks its list of dependent recursive next-hops and triggers re-resolution for each.

```c
/*
 * Handle a change to a route that's being used by recursive next-hops.
 * This function is called when an IGP route changes and needs to notify
 * any recursive next-hops that resolve through it.

```

This change handling is what makes recursive resolution practical at scale. When an IGP route changes, we re-resolve the affected recursive next-hops, but we only trigger dependent walks for those that actually changed resolution. If a route flaps but comes back to the same resolution, we don't propagate unnecessary updates through the hierarchy. This minimizes churn and keeps the system stable even during routing instability.

## Recursive Resolution and Prefix Independent Convergence

The most advanced use of recursive next-hops appears in Prefix Independent Convergence scenarios, which we'll cover in detail in another document. But the core idea is simple: if you have one million routes all recursing through the same next-hop address, and that next-hop has ECMP with multiple paths, when one ECMP path fails, you don't need to update one million routes. You update one recursive next-hop (removing the failed path from its ECMP group), and all one million routes automatically inherit the change.

This is called "prefix independent" because the convergence time doesn't depend on the number of prefixes (routes). Whether you have one route or one million routes using that next-hop, the convergence operation takes the same amount of time because it operates at the recursive next-hop level, not the route level.

Recursive next-hops are the mechanism that makes this possible. By explicitly modeling the indirection from routes to forwarding paths, we decouple the control plane concerns (which routes exist) from the forwarding plane concerns (how to forward traffic). This decoupling is what enables sub-second convergence even with millions of routes. The hierarchy absorbs complexity and converts it into efficiency.

# BGP Prefix Independent Convergence: Sub-Second Failover at Scale

## The Problem: BGP Convergence Doesn't Scale

Traditional BGP convergence has a fundamental scalability problem. When a BGP next-hop becomes unreachable, the router needs to find alternate paths for every BGP route using that next-hop. In a modern internet core router carrying a full BGP table of nearly one million routes, tens of thousands of routes might share the same BGP next-hop. If that next-hop fails, traditional convergence requires processing tens of thousands of route withdrawals, computing tens of thousands of best path calculations, and installing tens of thousands of new forwarding entries.

This processing takes time proportional to the number of affected routes. With fifty thousand routes to process, each taking a few milliseconds for path computation and FIB installation, you're looking at convergence times measured in seconds or even tens of seconds. During this convergence window, traffic is black-holed. Packets arrive at the router, get forwarded toward the failed next-hop, and disappear. For real-time applications like voice and video, multi-second outages are catastrophic.

The root cause of this problem is that traditional implementations couple route processing with forwarding path management. When a next-hop fails, they must iterate through every affected route, recompute its best path, and update its forwarding entry. The number of operations scales linearly with the number of routes. This linear scaling is what kills convergence at internet scale.

## The Solution: Decouple Routes from Forwarding Paths

Prefix Independent Convergence solves this by exploiting the hierarchy we've built with recursive next-hops. The key insight is that when a BGP next-hop becomes unreachable, we don't actually need to touch the individual BGP routes. The routes themselves haven't changed—they still have the same next-hop address, the same AS path, the same communities. What changed is how we reach that next-hop address.

In hierarchical FIB with recursive next-hops, BGP routes don't contain complete forwarding information. They contain a reference to a recursive next-hop object. That recursive next-hop object maintains the resolution to the actual forwarding path. When the forwarding path changes, we update the recursive next-hop object once, and all routes using it automatically inherit the change. The convergence time becomes constant—independent of the number of routes—because we're doing a fixed amount of work regardless of how many routes are affected.

This is revolutionary. It means that a router with one million BGP routes can converge from a next-hop failure in the same amount of time as a router with ten routes. The convergence time depends only on the number of unique BGP next-hops, not on the number of routes. And in typical internet routing, you have perhaps ten thousand unique next-hops for one million routes. That's a hundred-fold reduction in the convergence problem size.

## BGP PIC Core: Fast Convergence for IGP Failures

BGP PIC comes in two flavors that address different failure scenarios. BGP PIC Core handles failures in the IGP network—the internal network that connects BGP routers together. When an IGP link or node fails, affecting how we reach BGP next-hop addresses, PIC Core provides fast convergence.

In PIC Core scenarios, the BGP next-hop address itself is still valid and reachable, but the IGP path to reach it has changed. Maybe we were using one IGP path and it failed, so we need to switch to an alternate IGP path. With hierarchical FIB and recursive next-hops, this switch happens entirely at the IGP level without touching BGP routes.

This demonstrates the power of PIC Core. By exploiting the hierarchical FIB architecture with recursive next-hops and ECMP, we achieve convergence times measured in microseconds instead of seconds. The convergence time is independent of the number of BGP routes because we never touch the BGP routes. We only update the shared ECMP group that all routes use through the hierarchy.

## BGP PIC Edge: Fast Convergence for BGP Next-Hop Failures

BGP PIC Edge addresses a different failure scenario: when the BGP next-hop itself becomes completely unreachable. This happens when the remote PE router fails, or when all IGP paths to it fail. In this case, we can't just remove one path from ECMP. We need to switch to an entirely different BGP next-hop, which means using an alternate BGP path.

For PIC Edge to work, you need to have computed and stored alternate BGP paths before the failure. Most BGP implementations only keep the best path per prefix and discard alternates. But for PIC Edge, you need to keep at least one backup path per prefix, pre-compute its forwarding information, and have it ready to install instantly when the primary fails.

The challenge is memory. If you have one million BGP routes and you keep two paths per route, you've doubled your memory consumption. This is expensive. The solution is to exploit another level of hierarchy: backup path groups. Instead of storing complete alternate path information for each route, you store it once per BGP next-hop group. Routes share backup paths the same way they share primary paths.

BGP PIC Edge provides similar benefits to PIC Core, but for a different failure scenario. By pre-programming backup paths and using hierarchy to share them across routes, we achieve sub-millisecond convergence for complete next-hop failures. The key enabler is recursive next-hops: they provide the indirection layer that lets us switch paths without touching individual routes.

## The Economics of Prefix Independent Convergence

PIC has costs. You need to compute and store alternate paths. You need more memory to hold backup forwarding state. You need hardware support for pre-programming multiple paths. But these costs are fixed or grow slowly (linearly with next-hops), while the benefits grow dramatically with the number of routes.

Without PIC, convergence time grows linearly with route count. Ten thousand routes converge in X seconds, one million routes converge in 100X seconds. This doesn't scale to internet routing.

With PIC, convergence time is constant regardless of route count. Ten thousand routes converge in Y microseconds, one million routes still converge in Y microseconds. This scales perfectly.

The crossover point where PIC becomes essential is surprisingly low. If you have more than a few thousand routes sharing next-hops, PIC pays for itself. For internet-scale routing with hundreds of thousands of routes per next-hop, PIC is not optional. It's the difference between multi-second outages and sub-millisecond hitless failover. The hierarchical FIB architecture we've designed makes PIC possible by providing the recursive next-hop abstraction that decouples routes from forwarding paths.

# Fast ReRoute: Sub-50ms Protection Through Pre-Computed Backup Paths

## Beyond Convergence: Proactive Protection

BGP PIC gives us convergence in microseconds to milliseconds, which is impressive. But for carrier-grade networks carrying mission-critical traffic, even milliseconds of disruption can be too much. Voice calls can experience audible clicks. Video streams can stutter. Financial trading systems can lose money. Some applications demand protection so fast that there's effectively no disruption at all—packet loss measured in single digits, recovery time under fifty milliseconds.

This requirement drives us beyond reactive convergence to proactive protection. Instead of waiting for a failure to occur, detecting it, and then computing an alternate path, we pre-compute backup paths for every possible failure scenario. We program these backup paths into the hardware before anything fails. When a failure occurs, the hardware instantly switches to the pre-programmed backup path without any software involvement. The forwarding plane handles the failure autonomously in microseconds, while the control plane does slower cleanup in the background.

This is Fast ReRoute. It's not a new routing protocol or a new signaling mechanism. It's an architectural pattern for organizing forwarding state such that hardware can locally repair failures without waiting for routing protocols to converge. The hierarchical FIB architecture we've designed provides the perfect framework for implementing FRR because it already separates forwarding paths from routes and supports multiple levels of indirection.

## The FRR Model: Primary and Backup Paths

The core abstraction in FRR is simple: every forwarding decision has both a primary path and a pre-computed backup path. The primary path is what we use during normal operation. The backup path is what we switch to when the primary fails. Both paths are fully programmed in hardware ahead of time. The only thing that changes during failure is a pointer or flag indicating which path to use.

This model maps naturally to our hierarchical FIB. A next-hop object or resolution object can maintain both primary and backup resolution pointers. When we do a forward walk to program hardware, we walk both paths and program both. When a failure is detected (by hardware mechanisms like BFD or link-down detection), the hardware atomically switches from primary to backup. No software in the loop, no route recalculation, no table updates—just instant hardware-level failover.

Fast ReRoute is the ultimate expression of hierarchical FIB's power. By separating routes from forwarding paths, and by supporting multiple levels of resolution, we create a natural place to insert protection mechanisms. Routes don't know they're protected. They just use a resolution object that happens to have FRR. The FRR logic is completely encapsulated in that resolution layer.

This composability is what makes the architecture scalable. You can add FRR protection to specific critical paths without touching routes. You can remove protection if it's no longer needed. You can upgrade from link protection to path protection by changing the FRR object without touching anything above it. The hierarchy provides clean separation of concerns, and FRR is one of the most important concerns it separates.

## FRR Requirements on Hardware

FRR only works if the hardware supports it. You need ASICs that can maintain backup next-hops, detect failures locally, and switch between paths without software involvement. Most modern carrier-grade ASICs support this through features like:

- Fast failure detection (sub-50ms BFD, instant link-down detection)
- Backup next-hop pointers in forwarding tables
- Atomic switchover from primary to backup (single clock cycle)
- Protection of the backup path from being used for normal traffic

The hierarchical FIB software architecture enables FRR, but the hardware must cooperate. The software pre-programs both paths using forward walks. The software links them using hardware APIs. But when failure strikes, hardware handles it autonomously. Software just updates its state for monitoring and eventually triggers background repair processes.

This hardware-software co-design is critical. The software hierarchy provides the abstraction and the programming model. The hardware provides the performance and the instant failover. Together, they deliver carrier-grade protection: sub-50ms recovery with minimal packet loss, scaling to millions of routes, and transparent to the routes being protected.

# BGP Labeled Unicast and SR-MPLS: Protocol Implementation in Hierarchical FIB

## Why Protocols Need Hierarchical FIB

Up to now, we've discussed the hierarchical FIB architecture in abstract terms—resolution objects, recursive next-hops, forward walks, and dependent walks. But how do real routing protocols actually use this infrastructure? When BGP learns a route or when Segment Routing computes a path, how does that translate into the data structures and operations we've designed?

This document bridges theory and practice by showing how specific protocols map onto hierarchical FIB. We'll focus on BGP Labeled Unicast and Segment Routing MPLS because they're complex enough to exercise all aspects of the hierarchy, yet common enough to be practically relevant. Understanding these mappings will show you how to integrate any routing protocol into the hierarchical framework.

## BGP Labeled Unicast: Internet-Scale Label Distribution

BGP Labeled Unicast (BGP-LU) solves a specific problem in service provider networks. When you build a multi-domain MPLS network where different IGP domains need to exchange labeled routes, you can't use IGP for label distribution because IGP doesn't scale across domain boundaries. But you can use BGP, which is designed for internet-scale route distribution.

In BGP-LU, BGP carries not just IP prefixes but also MPLS labels. When a BGP speaker advertises a prefix, it allocates an MPLS label for that prefix and advertises both the prefix and label together. Other BGP speakers learn this prefix-label binding and use it to build label switched paths across the network. This enables MPLS services like L3VPN to work across multiple IGP domains or even across autonomous systems.

The hierarchical FIB integration point is straightforward: a BGP-LU route is just a regular route that points to a label operation, which in turn points to a recursive next-hop for the BGP next-hop address. The label comes from BGP, the resolution comes from IGP, and the hierarchy ties them together naturally.

The BGP-LU example shows how routing protocol features map cleanly onto hierarchical FIB. BGP-LU needs labels and recursive resolution. The hierarchy provides label operations and recursive next-hops. BGP-LU needs to handle incoming labeled traffic and outgoing labeled traffic. The hierarchy supports both through forward walks and MPLS FIB integration. Everything fits together naturally because the hierarchy was designed with protocol needs in mind.

## Segment Routing MPLS: Source Routing Meets Hierarchy

Segment Routing (SR) is conceptually different from traditional MPLS. In traditional MPLS, each router makes an independent forwarding decision based on the top label. In Segment Routing, the source router specifies the complete path by stacking multiple labels (segments), and transit routers just pop labels and forward. The source router has complete control over the path.

This creates interesting challenges for hierarchical FIB. The source router needs to compute a label stack that represents the desired path, potentially with dozens of labels for complex traffic engineering. These labels need to be pushed onto packets, but the underlying transport to reach the first segment might itself use hierarchical resolution. We end up with SR label stacks on top of hierarchical resolution underneath.

The beauty of our architecture is that it handles this naturally. An SR path becomes a multi-label push operation. That operation points to a next-hop (usually the adjacent segment). That next-hop might be directly connected, or it might need recursive resolution. The hierarchy accommodates SR's requirements without special-casing.

Segment Routing shows that our hierarchical architecture isn't limited to traditional hop-by-hop routing. Source-routed protocols like SR can coexist naturally with traditional protocols. The SR label stack sits at one level of the hierarchy. The IGP resolution that actually delivers packets to the first segment sits at another level. They compose cleanly through the standard resolution mechanism.

## Protocol Integration Patterns

Looking at BGP-LU and SR-MPLS reveals common patterns for integrating any protocol into hierarchical FIB:

First, identify what the protocol provides and what it needs. BGP-LU provides labels and needs next-hop resolution. SR provides label stacks and needs first-hop resolution. Every protocol has inputs (information it provides) and outputs (forwarding actions it needs).

Second, map protocol concepts to FIB abstractions. Labels become LabelOperations. Next-hops become RecursiveNextHops or DirectNextHops. Paths become chains of resolution objects. This mapping is usually straightforward because the FIB abstractions were designed to match protocol needs.

Third, leverage the hierarchy for efficiency. If your protocol has shared state (like BGP next-hops shared by many routes), factor that state into a shared resolution object. If your protocol has layered dependencies (like SR on top of IGP), express those as hierarchy levels. The architecture's power comes from exploiting sharing and layering.

Fourth, trust the walk algorithms. Don't try to manually track all dependencies. Instead, build proper dependent relationships and let dependent walk handle propagation. Don't try to manually program hardware. Instead, build proper resolution chains and let forward walk gather the information. The walk algorithms are generic and handle all protocols uniformly.

These patterns make protocol integration mechanical rather than ad-hoc. You're not writing custom code for each protocol. You're expressing the protocol's behavior in terms of standard abstractions, and the infrastructure handles the rest. This is how the hierarchical FIB scales to support many protocols without becoming a tangled mess of protocol-specific logic.

# Hardware Abstraction Layer: Programming Hierarchical FIB into ASICs

## The Gap Between Software and Silicon

We have designed an elegant hierarchical FIB in software with routes, resolution objects, recursive next-hops, label operations, and ECMP groups. But this software data structure exists in DRAM on a control plane CPU. The actual packet forwarding happens in specialized ASIC chips with completely different architectures—hardware tables with fixed formats, pipeline stages with specific capabilities, and memory hierarchies optimized for line-rate lookups. The gap between our flexible software hierarchy and rigid hardware tables is enormous.

This gap is where the Hardware Abstraction Layer lives. The HAL is the translation layer that takes our hierarchical software structures and programs them into whatever hardware tables and formats the ASIC requires. Different ASICs have radically different architectures. Broadcom chips have one table organization. Cisco chips have another. Intel chips have yet another. The HAL must understand both our software hierarchy and the specific hardware it's programming, and create correct mappings between them.

The brilliance of hierarchical FIB is that it makes the HAL's job possible. Without hierarchy, each route would be a monolithic blob of forwarding state that needs custom translation for each hardware platform. With hierarchy, we have modular pieces that map to hardware primitives in well-defined ways. Label operations map to EEDB entries. Next-hops map to adjacency tables. ECMP groups map to ECMP hardware structures. The hierarchy doesn't just help scalability and convergence—it's what makes hardware abstraction practical.

This hardware model is simplified but captures the key concepts. Real ASICs have dozens more tables, but FEC, EEDB, and ECMP are the core structures. The FEC table is where routes point to determine forwarding actions. The EEDB is where encapsulations live. ECMP groups enable load balancing. Everything else is variations on these themes.

## Programming Hierarchy into Hardware: The Translation Process

Now comes the critical question: how do we take our hierarchical software structures and program them into these hardware tables? The answer is forward walk combined with resource allocation. We walk the hierarchy starting from a route, gathering information at each level, allocating hardware resources as needed, and programming those resources with the gathered information.

The process must handle several complexities. First, resource sharing—multiple software objects might map to the same hardware resource. Second, dependency ordering—we must program lower-level resources before higher-level resources that reference them. Third, hardware limitations—we might need to collapse multiple software layers into fewer hardware layers if the ASIC doesn't support deep chaining. Fourth, make-before-break—we must allocate new resources before freeing old ones to avoid traffic loss.

Let me show you the complete programming flow:

This programming flow shows the complete translation from hierarchical software to flat hardware. We walk the hierarchy to gather information. We allocate hardware resources from bottom up. We program each resource with the appropriate data. We link them together through hardware pointers. And finally, we update our software tracking to record the hardware IDs.

The key insight is that forward walk gives us all the information we need to program hardware, but we must respect hardware constraints. If hardware doesn't support deep EEDB chaining, we might need to collapse multiple label operations into a single EEDB entry with a label stack. If hardware has limited FEC entries, we might need to share FECs more aggressively. The HAL handles these hardware-specific adaptations while preserving the semantics expressed in the software hierarchy.

## Make-Before-Break in Hardware Programming

One of the most critical HAL responsibilities is implementing make-before-break semantics when updating hardware. When a route's resolution changes, we can't just delete the old FEC and create a new one. During that deletion and creation, packets would arrive and find no FEC entry, causing traffic loss. We must create the new FEC first, update all references to point to it, and only then delete the old FEC.

This gets complicated when resources are shared. If multiple routes share an EEDB entry and one route needs an update, we can't modify the EEDB in place because other routes are still using the old version. We must create a new EEDB, update only the affected route's FEC to point to the new EEDB, and keep the old EEDB until all routes have migrated away from it.

```

Make-before-break is what enables hitless updates in carrier networks. Without it, every routing change would cause micro-outages as hardware entries are reprogrammed. With it, we can change routing while maintaining continuous packet forwarding. The HAL is responsible for orchestrating this dance of resource allocation, reference counting, and careful sequencing to achieve zero packet loss during updates.

## Hardware Diversity and Abstraction

Different ASICs have wildly different architectures, and the HAL must abstract these differences. Some chips have deep EEDB chaining. Others have flat encapsulation tables. Some support native ECMP in hardware. Others require software to maintain ECMP group state. Some have built-in FRR support with backup FECs. Others require complex workarounds.

The hierarchical FIB architecture helps because it provides a common vocabulary that can map to many different hardware models. A LabelOperation might become a chained EEDB entry on Broadcom, a flat encapsulation entry on Cisco, or a special label table entry on Intel. The software hierarchy doesn't change. Only the HAL's mapping changes.

This is the ultimate value of the HAL: it isolates the rest of the system from hardware details. Routing protocols don't know about FECs and EEDBs. They work with routes and resolution objects. The FIB core doesn't know about specific ASIC quirks. It maintains the hierarchy and performs walks. Only the HAL knows about hardware, and even then, it uses the hierarchy as its interface to the rest of the system. This clean separation is what makes the architecture portable across different hardware platforms while maintaining correctness and performance.

# Complete System Integration: L3VPN End-to-End Example

## Bringing It All Together

We have explored hierarchical FIB piece by piece—routes, resolution objects, walks, ECMP, labels, recursive next-hops, PIC, FRR, and hardware abstraction. Now it's time to see how all these components work together in a realistic, complete scenario. Nothing demonstrates the power and elegance of the architecture better than watching it handle a complex service like L3VPN with all its requirements for scalability, rapid convergence, and traffic engineering.

L3VPN is the perfect integration example because it exercises every aspect of hierarchical FIB. It has multiple hierarchy levels (VPN route, VPN label, transport tunnel, IGP resolution). It needs massive scale (thousands of VPN routes per customer, hundreds of customers). It requires fast convergence (PIC Core and PIC Edge). It benefits from traffic engineering (SR-MPLS tunnels). And it must program complex hardware (multi-label stacks, ECMP, protection). If we can make L3VPN work elegantly in hierarchical FIB, we can make anything work.

## The L3VPN Scenario: Enterprise Multi-Site VPN

Let me describe a realistic service provider scenario. An enterprise customer has three sites connected through an MPLS VPN service. The service provider network has multiple PE routers (Provider Edge) where customer sites connect, and P routers (Provider core) that carry traffic between PEs. Each customer site needs full connectivity to other sites, but traffic must remain isolated from other customers' traffic. This is what L3VPN provides.

The network topology looks like this:
- Customer Site A connects to PE1
- Customer Site B connects to PE2  
- Customer Site C connects to PE3
- PE routers are interconnected through P routers using IGP (OSPF) and MPLS
- BGP distributes VPN routes between PEs
- Each customer has their own VRF (VPN Routing and Forwarding) instance

Let's build this scenario step by step in hierarchical FIB, showing how each component contributes to the complete solution.

## The Power of Integration

This complete L3VPN example demonstrates why hierarchical FIB is not just an academic exercise but a practical necessity for modern networks. Look at what we achieved:

We installed VPN routes without knowing anything about the physical network topology. The routes just point to recursive next-hops. Those recursive next-hops resolve through IGP. IGP resolves to physical interfaces. Each layer manages its own concerns, and the hierarchy ties them together automatically.

When IGP fails over, we don't touch VPN routes. When BGP next-hops change, we don't reprogram label operations. When MAC addresses update, we don't modify routes. Each layer updates independently, and the hierarchy propagates changes through walks. This separation of concerns is what enables both scale and speed.

The hardware abstraction layer programs everything correctly without understanding the service-level semantics. It just walks the hierarchy, allocates resources, and programs tables. The hardware doesn't know about VPNs or BGP or recursive resolution. It just forwards packets based on tables that the HAL programmed from the hierarchy.

## Lessons for Implementation

If you're building a real forwarding system, this L3VPN example teaches several critical lessons:

First, design your data structures to match the natural hierarchy of routing protocols. Don't flatten everything prematurely. The hierarchy exists for a reason—it reflects how routing protocols actually work and how networks are actually built.

Second, invest in walk algorithms early. Forward walk and dependent walk are not optional features you add later. They are fundamental operations that everything else builds on. Get them right, and the rest follows naturally.

Third, make resource sharing explicit. Don't duplicate information. Factor out common state into shared objects and let multiple routes reference them. The memory savings are significant, but the convergence benefits are even more important.

Fourth, abstract hardware early. Don't let hardware details leak into your routing protocols. Build a HAL that translates between hierarchical software and hardware tables. This pays off immediately when you need to support multiple ASIC types.

Fifth, think about failure scenarios from the beginning. PIC, FRR, and make-before-break are not features you bolt on later. They require architectural support in your core data structures. Design for fast convergence and hitless updates from day one.

The hierarchical FIB architecture we've built handles all of this. It scales to millions of routes. It converges in milliseconds. It supports complex services like L3VPN naturally. It programs diverse hardware efficiently. And it does all this not through tricks or hacks, but through clean architecture that matches the problem domain. This is what good system design looks like.
